# file-script-runner

## About

Essentially, you can setup a global command using VSCODE settings page and yes you can include arguments (its a free text, so go crazy :smile: ). What it does is, prepending the command with the file name.

To activate:

1. Right click on the editor tab and click `Run Script`.
